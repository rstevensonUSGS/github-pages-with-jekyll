## Day in the Life of a Developer ## 
 So today, I started a detailwith a team called Web informatics and Mapping or WIM for short. 
 So far I have been working on Github Labs in order to learn and understand how github works. 
 This has been an interesting experiance in learning how to build my protfolio.
 Also, I am learning how to work with Markdown.
